# layermanager
A simple python script making you able to automatically download &amp; install all of 7GranDad's Translation Layers.

# Usage Guide:

## 1. Download Node.js
Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/ and install it with it's dependencies.

## 2. Download LayerManager
Go to the lastest release and download the "LayerManager.exe" and run it
If it asks you if you wanna use the default filepath, incase you already have the layers stored somewhere, you can select those paths,
in any other case I'd recommend using the default ones.

## 3. Set up the layers
To set up the layers, first click the "Check/Update" button on the layer you wish to start. As soon as the update is done, click the "Setup" button and wait till it's done.

## 4. Start the layer
To start a layer, simply click the "Start" button. In case of MiniBlox and BloxD,
you need specific things to play, more on that later.
To join the server, simply connect to "localhost" through your multiplayer menu on version 1.8, or use ViaFabricPlus (https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) for newer version clients.

## 5. How to join MiniBlox
To "join" MiniBlox, the steps are the same as in 4, but since MiniBlox's Prediction AntiCheat came out,
you need to send C0CInput packets along with ticks to be able to move which only a few client's have.
